# Age Recognition


## Please check out the master brnach for completed project


#### Abstract

Through analysing a multiple data sets, like the pan 2014 or the Schler data set, we plan on building a model that will be able to predict an authors age based on their writing style and themes. For this we will first pre-process text data from either blogs or tweets, by for example removing stop words, tokenizing and further fine tuning based on the text type(Tweet or blog), and then use this processed data to train a model.

#### Research Question

* Can we predict Age based on writing style using Machin learning
* Is this genre/text type specific 
* Does writing style change continuously or does it "flatten" and become "stable" at a certain age 



#### Dataset 

Schler dataset:

* blogs from 2004
* 19 320 authors 
* age range 13 -47
* csv file -> (age and text extraction through column index(like in assignment3))
* further info: Gender, Topic/Occupation ,Sign , Date

Pan 2016 data set:

* Tweets from 2016
* Info : Age , Gender ,Date
* Will need to be downloaded (have to wait for access)
* .xml file
